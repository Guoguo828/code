This program is intended to measure the runtime of four  search methodologies: the iterative binary search, the recursive binary search, the iterative linear search, and the recursive linear search. 
Here is a guide on how to utilize this program efficiently:

1. Compilation:
    - Please ensure you have a C compiler  on your system like mingw64.
    - Compile the program with tools like vscode or Dev
2. Execution:
    - open the programmer on your code editor
    - Run the compiled program and keep your computer charged
    - Once execution, the program will ask you to input the size of the array.

3. Input:
    - Enter an integer value to specify the size of the array, like 1000 or 2000.
    - Note: larger array sizes may result in longer execution times.

4. Output:
    - The program will display the tick count and the execution duration for each of the four search methods.
    - The tick count indicates the total number of clock cycles that have passed while the algorithm is running.
    - The execution time is given in seconds.

5. Understanding Results:
    - Lower times means faster search performance under the same times of repetition.
    - Compare the performance of different algorithms and choose the one that suits you best.

6. Repetition:
    - Initailly, The program is programmed to repeats each search algorithm 100,000 times to ensure accurate timing measurements.
    - The repeated times can be changed , just need to modify the number in for-loop of each algorithm in the main program

7. Interpretation of Output:
    - Check to see if the search times are about the same each time you run the program to figure out if the timing is dependable.
    - Keep in mind that the search times might be a bit different because of what else your computer is doing , how busy it is , computer performance and so on .
8. Further Customization:
    - Update the program code to change the number of times the search is repeated or to tweak the search methods according to your requirements.
    - Feel free to try out arrays of different lengths and various search values to observe how the algorithms perform in different situations.

9. utilize:
    - Use this program to explore and compare the efficiency of different searching algorithms.
    - Gain more insights into algorithmic time complexity and enhance your understanding of search techniques.
